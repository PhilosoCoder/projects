Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0’s and 1’s.
How many n-digit binary numbers are there that don’t have two adjacent 1 bits?

For example, here are the three-digit numbers:

000 001 010011 100 101110 111

Five of the possible eight combinations meet the criteria


What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?

Fn(0) + Fn(1)


Having worked out the pattern, there’s a second part to the question: can you prove why the relationship exists?

    0 00 000 0000 1bit -> 2
    01 001 0001 2bit ->(0)1 x 2 +(1)1 x 1 = 3
    1 010 0010 3bit ->(0)1

    x(1 x 2) + (1) 1 x 1 x 2
        10 0100
        100 0101
        101
        1000
        1010
        1001

    Fn(0) = 1, if n = 1
            2, if n = 2
    Fn - 1 + Fn - 2 + ... + F0, if n > = 3

    Fn(1) = 0, if n = 0
            1, if n = 1
    Fn - 1 + Fn - 2 + ... + F0, if n >= 2

Let's break down the provided explanation:

    Observation of Patterns:
        For n = 1, there are two possibilities: 0 and 1.
        For n = 2, there are three possibilities: 00, 01, and 10.
        For n = 3, there are five possibilities: 000, 001, 010, 100, and 101.
        For n = 4, there are eight possibilities: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000, 0101, 1001, and 1010.

    Recursive Pattern:
        The number of possibilities for n is determined by adding the possibilities for n-1 and n-2.
        Specifically, if we start a sequence with 0, the remaining (n-1) digits must form a valid sequence for n-1.
        If we start a sequence with 1, the second digit is 0, and the remaining (n-2) digits must form a valid sequence for n-2.
        The total count for n is the sum of counts for n-1 and n-2.

    Recurrence Relation:
        The recurrence relation for this problem is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.
        Fn(0) = 1 (for n = 1), Fn(1) = 2 (for n = 2)
        For n > 2: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 + ... + F0 (if starting with 1), and Fn-1 + Fn-2 + ... + F0 (if starting with 0).

    General Formulas:
        Fn(0) = 1 (for n = 1), Fn(1) = 2 (for n = 2)
        Fn(0) = 0 (for n = 0), Fn(1) = 1 (for n = 1)
        For n > 2: Fn(0) = 1, Fn(1) = 2, and Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 + ... +
        F0 (if starting with 1), or Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 + ... + F0 (if starting with 0).

    Proving the Relationship:
        The relationship between the counts for n and the sum of counts for n-1 and n-2 holds true,
        similar to the Fibonacci sequence.
        This can be proven using mathematical induction or recurrence relation analysis.

In conclusion, the number of n-digit binary sequences without two adjacent 1 bits follows a recursive pattern,
and the relationship can be described using a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence.
