The decision between using classes and hashes (or associative arrays, dictionaries, etc.)
for handling data in an export utility involves various trade-offs.
Here are the top three advantages and disadvantages of each approach:
Using Classes:

Advantages:

    Encapsulation and Abstraction: Classes provide a way to encapsulate data and behavior, promoting abstraction.
    This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

    Reuse and Extensibility: Business objects and persistence mechanisms can be reused in other parts of the application.
    The code can be extended more easily by creating new classes or modifying existing ones.

    Type Safety: Using classes often provides type safety, which can catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
    This can lead to more robust and reliable code.

Disadvantages:

    Complexity: Introducing classes might lead to a more complex and formalized structure,
    which could be overkill for a simple utility. It might be more effort to set up and maintain.

    Flexibility: While classes can be flexible, they may not adapt as quickly to changes in requirements.
    Modifying classes might require more effort than adjusting a hash-based solution.

    Performance Overhead: Depending on the complexity, the overhead of object creation, instantiation,
    and method calls could impact performance compared to a more lightweight solution.

Using Hashes:

Advantages:

    Flexibility and Dynamism: Hashes provide flexibility, allowing dynamic changes without the need for formal class definitions.
    Fields can be added or modified on-the-fly.

    Simplicity: The hash-based approach might be simpler and more straightforward for a specific use case.
    It requires less upfront design and can be more agile.

    Readability: For certain scenarios, working with hashes might lead to more readable and concise code,
    especially when dealing with data manipulation and transformation.

Disadvantages:

    Lack of Structure: Without the structure provided by classes, the code might become less organized and more prone to errors,
    especially in large-scale applications.

    Reusability: Hashes might not encourage code reuse as much as classes.
    Logic related to data manipulation might need to be duplicated across different parts of the code.

    Debugging Challenges: Debugging might be more challenging due to the lack of a formalized structure.
    Identifying errors and their sources could be more time-consuming.

Considerations:

    Dynamic vs. Static Typing: The choice between classes and hashes can be related to the dynamic vs. static typing debate.
    Classes in statically-typed languages offer compile-time type checks,
    while hashes in dynamically-typed languages provide more flexibility.

    Project Scale and Requirements: The scale of the project and the specific requirements of the export utility should heavily
    influence the decision. For a small, rapidly changing utility, hashes might be more suitable.
    For a large, enterprise-level application, classes could offer better maintainability.

    Team Expertise: The team's expertise and familiarity with the chosen paradigm play a crucial role.
    If the team is well-versed in object-oriented programming, using classes might be a more natural choice.

In conclusion, the decision should be based on the specific needs and constraints of the project.
A hybrid approach, combining the strengths of both classes and hashes,
might also be considered for achieving a balance between formality and flexibility.
